With the release (or re-release) of [Zig's New Async I/O](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/25592), I wanted to throw my hat in the ring with Talos attempt at colorless functions for it's concurrency model.

<h4 className="mt-4">Recapping Async/Await</h4>

> Function coloring stems from the language syntax that then describes to the runtime how a function should be executed. Functions of a particular color may then only be called from a function of the same color.

There have been some excellent posts that go into more detail that I strongly recommend:

-   [Let Futures be Futures](https://without.boats/blog/let-futures-be-futures/) by _Without Boats_ <span className="text-secondary">(February 3, 2024)</span>

All of these posts explain in varying yet strikingly similar terms how the asynchronous calling conventions for certain languages _\*cough\* JavaScript \*cough\*_, resulting in an upwards poisoning effect where parent functions are also forced to be asynchronous. An examples of this can be found as:

```js
function blue() { await red(); /** an error would occur here */ }
async function red() { blue(); await red(); /** both valid calls */ }
```

This is similar to Zig's previous model of concurrency described by Without Boats, which expressed coroutines with async/await but did not require the `async` declaration for functions.

```zig
const net = @import("std").net;

// The original, special declaration to enable evented I/O.
pub const io_mode = .evented;

pub fn main() !void {
    const addr = try net.Address.parseIp("127.0.0.1", 7000);
    var sendFrame = async send_message(addr);
    try await sendFrame; // And await the message
}

// Note how the function definition doesn't require the `async` marking.
fn send_message(addr: net.Address) !void {
    var socket = try net.tcpConnectToAddress(addr);
    defer socket.close(); // Defer the close handler.
    _ = try await async socket.write("Hello World!\n");
}
```

<h4 className="mt-4">Inversion of Concurrency</h4>

Eventually, Zig decided to [remove the async/await keywords](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/abfed1708862716b7b54ce8ea349ce7215a9fab4) and move towards a userland model instead. This led to the introduction of a new interface that would handle all asynchronous execution. This led to the following calling convention for coroutines in Zig:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

// Some long-running task that.
fn task(io: std.Io, data: []const u8) !void {
    std.debug.print("Hello, {s}!\n", .{data});
}

// Handles executing multiple tasks.
fn execute(io: std.Io) !void {
    var a = io.async(task, .{"Future A"});
    var b = io.async(task, .{"Future B"});

    try a.await(io);
    try b.await(io);
}
```

> For a more detailed overview of Zig's new async I/O, Loris Cro has a [secondary post](https://kristoff.it/blog/zig-new-async-io/) doing so.

The change from using `await` as a keyword to instead being a method the `Future` struct contains, effectively inverts the previous calling conventions. This is possible as all `await` calls are effectively blocking for the scope of a function. This removal has a few benefits, such as allowing _all_ functions to possible be called asynchronously regardless of declaration, user-defined scheduling based on the runtime dependency, and improving method-chaining for nested properties.

```js
// Some awaitable structure the is generated.
const promise = new Promise(...);

// With the `old` calling convention:
(await promise).property();

// With Zigs `new` calling convention:
promise.await().property();
```

However these benefits come at one major cost to use, the dependency on `std.Io` for execution. In their attempt to remove function coloring, Zig has come full-circle and reinvented the wheel as all asynchronous functions now require a runtime structure to emulate the removed `await` call.

In allow `await` method calls to occur in any context, `async` calls will instead only be callable with a runtime available. This could be circumvented by using a global variable for the runtime, however the [evilness](https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/global-variables-are-evil-and-unsafe/) of such an action has been extensively discussed.

<h4 className="mt-4">Unconventional Conventions</h4>

With all things considered, solving colorless functions appears to be a daunting problem. However, perhaps using a mix of conventions could be the solution.

<h5 className="mt-3">Awaiting Futures</h5>

Let's start our design using [Talos](/projects/talos) and keep Zig's `Future` object so that `future.await(){:zig}` is still valid. This would allow us to `.await` on any `Future` or awaitable object that is created.

For the creation of futures, we could use a global variable for launching asynchronous functions to circumvent the runtime dependency that Zig contains.

```talos
// Some long-running task callback.
let callback = fn { ... };

// Launch a task with `...` arguments.
let future = Future.async(callback, ...);

// And then await for the result from anywhere.
let result = future.await();
```

Although this does exhibit the aforementioned evil global variable, since Talos implements concurrency internally with green threads (eg: userland cannot modify scheduling), this is a perfectly acceptable solution.

But can we improve on this and allow for multiple runtime targets?

<h5 className="mt-3">Deferring Futures</h5>

We could take Zig's original syntax for launching coroutines by using the `async callback(...){:zig}` syntax. However this exhibits the same readability issues with the `(await future).property(){:zig}` style. So let's instead apply the `async` operator as an infix instead of a prefix. This would give us the following syntax:

```talos
// Possible inversion of the `async` operator.
let future = callback async(...);

// Alternatively any operator sigil could be used.
let other = callback::(...);

// This allows us to keep our clean method-chaining.
callback async().await().property();
callback::().await().property();
```

This also _could_ allow us to bind alternate runtimes if this capability is possible in the underlying language.

```talos
// Potential runtime mixin for `async` operators.
let future = callback async[runtime](...);

// Alternative runtime mixing for a sigil operator.
let other = callback:runtime:(...);
```

> **Note:** Currently Talos uses the `Future.async` static method to launch asynchronous execution. Eventually I would like to expand on this with the above syntax, but like any other programming language architect, I think there is still some room for improvement with the syntax (at least with readability).

<h4 className="mt-4">Joining Threads</h4>

Quite clearly, these speculations for potential async/await syntax exceed what a normal programming language would normally exhibit. However I think that inverting the normal conventions as Zig has done will lead to a language with truly colorblind functions. As such, moving asynchronous execution to function calls instead of their declarations could lead to the final thread to finish the concurrency tapestry.
