Whilst I was developing a testing framework for [Talos](/projects/talos), I found myself needing a reasonably performant file-globbing library. However, after spending some time searching, I could not find any adequate C++ solutions.

As such I decided to go down the rabbit-hole constructing one myself and seeing how I could possible improve performance where necessary.

<h4 className="mt-4">Humble Beginnings</h4>

Before worrying about recursing over directories and improving performance, I looked around for an already performant glob matching implementation. This is where I came across [`oxc-project/fast-glob`](https://github.com/oxc-project/fast-glob), which does just that. This would allow me to write the following for any path that could be matched:

```cpp
// a complex glob that requires the matching algorithm
auto glob = "some/**/path/**/n*[k-m]e?txt";

// a potential path that should succeed
auto path = "some/small/or/large/path/to/a/needle.txt";

// the current reference implementation for glob matching
assert(Aster::Match::glob(glob, path));
```
