Currently I am working for [SPLat Controls](https://www.splatco.com/) developing their custom IDE and compilation toolchain for the SPLat programming language and virtual machine.

In my free time, I am working on my own programming language [Talos](/projects/talos) whilst also spending a inordinate amount of time skiing and travelling.
