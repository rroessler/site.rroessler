This website is an [open-source](https://github.com/rroessler/site.rroessler) static [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application running on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

For those interested, the tech-stack that I am using is:

-   [Nextra](https://nextra.site/)
-   [Halfmoon UI](https://www.gethalfmoon.com/)
-   [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)

I chose to write my website this way as it allowed me to deploy for free, use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for rendering my posts/projects, and for the creation of a performant and well-optimized static site. Alongside these items, I also used [Bun](https://bun.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the websites development.
